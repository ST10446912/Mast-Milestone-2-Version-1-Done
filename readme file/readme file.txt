#(A brief over View)

Introduction

Dining is just one example of how technology is constantly changing how we connect with our environment in today's fast-paced world. Let me introduce you to the Digital Menu App, a revolutionary solution that aims to improve eating experiences by using ease and creativity. With a number of features that improve customer happiness and restaurant operating efficiency, this app is a major improvement over traditional paper menus.

The Digital Menu App's primary benefit is its capacity to offer a smooth and engaging menu experience. The days of turning pages of paper menus are long gone since they are laborious and prone to damage. Alternatively, customers may peruse an elegant, intuitive digital interface that provides comprehensive explanations, excellent photos, and even videos of food. This aesthetic appeal improves the whole eating experience for patrons while also assisting them in making well-informed decisions.

The Digital Menu App is incredibly beneficial for both restaurant owners and employees. Customers will always have access to the most recent information thanks to real-time updates, which enable quick changes to menu items, pricing, and promotions. This adaptability lowers the possibility of misunderstandings and facilitates better inventory management. Moreover, integrated elements that expedite the eating experience by eliminating wait times and enhancing service effectiveness include online ordering and payment.

Additionally, the Digital Menu App makes eating more customized. The app may personalize recommendations depending on user preferences thanks to features like order history and personalized recommendations based on past selections. In addition to increasing client pleasure, this customisation encourages recurring business.

Conclusion

To sum up, the Digital Menu App is a game-changer that improves diners' experiences and simplifies operations for eateries, much beyond being merely a contemporary convenience. These kinds of improvements will become more and more essential to the restaurant business as technology develops, raising the bar for efficiency, convenience, and patron happiness. With the help of the Digital Menu App, welcome to the future of eating.

Video on how the app works into action

#Reason for using Github Actions Reason for using Github: We are using github for the purpose for us to edit and still push many times as we can and the readme file will work.

About Github: Steps: These are the individual tasks that make up a job.

Each step can run commands (run:), run setup tasks (uses:) set job-level environment variables. The steps include checking out the repository setting up Java running tests building the project creating APKs and AABs uploading the build artifacts to GitHub. More about github:

Name: This is the name of the workflow that appears on GitHub when the action is run.

Env: These are environment variables accessible to all jobs and steps in the workflow. In this case, main_project_module is set to app, and playstore_name is set to IIECat.

On: This section defines the events that will trigger the workflow. In this case, the workflow will run when there’s a push to the release branch or when the workflow is manually triggered from the Actions tab (workflow_dispatch).

Jobs: This section contains all the jobs that will be run in the workflow. In this case, there’s only one job named build.

Runs-On: This specifies the type of machine to run the job on. Here, it’s set to run on the latest version of Ubuntu.

Uses: This is used to include external actions. For example, actions/checkout@v3 checks out your repository onto the runner, and actions/setup-java@v3 sets up a JDK environment for use in actions.
